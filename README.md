1-This project demonstrates the creation of a basic 2D space shooter game using the Pygame library. Players control a spaceship and navigate through space while avoiding enemy obstacles. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by staying alive and avoiding collisions.

2-Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library
You can install the Pygame library using the following command:
--bash
pip install pygame

3-Installation
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
--bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2d-space-shooter.git
Navigate to the project directory.
--bash
cd 2d-space-shooter

4-Gameplay
Run the game script:
--bash
python game.py
Control the spaceship using the left and right arrow keys.
Avoid collisions with enemy obstacles to stay alive.
Score points by surviving longer and avoiding collisions.
Press the close button (X) to exit the game.

5-Customization
Replace the player.png and enemy.png images with your own graphics.
Modify the game constants in the script to adjust gameplay parameters.
Add sound effects and background music for a more immersive experience.

6-Acknowledgments
This game was created as an educational project to demonstrate the basics of 2D game development using the Pygame library.
